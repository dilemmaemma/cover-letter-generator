# About
This is a basic web app that allows for user input that will in turn create a cover letter for the user. After it generates the letter, it will email it to you at the email you put into the form.

##Things to Remember:
- Double check your email!
- If the email does not appear in your inbox a few minutes after hitting submit, check your junk mail (it usually appears here)
- This is not a fool proof method! Always make sure to proof the cover letter and input any additional information needed

##Information Required:
- Your name
- Job position/title
- Programming languages you know
- Frameworks/dependencies you know
- Company name
- Your github link
- Three of your top github projects, along with the status of them (complete or in progress)
- Your phone number
- Your email

##Statement of Disclosure:
None of your info is used beyond generating the cover letter. It is not stored in a database or released to any additional parties. After use, the data is terminated.
